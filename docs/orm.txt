ORM => Object Related Model

we use it to get data from database

exmaple model = Article

!Article.objects.
  - all() = to take all data model
  - order_by('title') = to take data sorted/ordered by title
  - reverse() = to reverse the original data
  - get(pk=1) to take object with has id/pk equal 1

    if we have:
        - primary model: Category
        - secondary model/related model: Article
    we can get all Article models related with Category:
      - category = Category.objects.get(pk=1)
      - category.article_set.all()

      or use it with related_name var which you add to the category = models.ForeignKey()
        - category.[related_name].all()

  with filters:
    to use some filters/lookups you need to write [fieldName]__[filter]

    - gt = Greater than
      * id__gt=4 = (gt = Greeter than) id which more than 4
    - gte = Greater than or equal to
      * id__gt=4 = (gt = Greeter than) id which more or equal 4
    - lt = less than
    - lte = less than or equal to
    - startswith = return objects with startswith (title)
    - contains = return (title) with container (some string) with register
    - icontains = return (title) with container (some string) w/0 register
    - in=(1, 5, 6) = return if (id) return all objects if the pk maths with the values in a list
      * in param we can also use a Querysets as:
        - categories = Category.objects.filter(pk__in=[1,2])
        - articles = Article.objects.filter(category__in=cats)
    - range=(1, 10) = return all elements from (pk) 1 to 10
    - exact=5 return objects with (id) 5
    - iexact = with register
    - first = to get first element from a model list
    - last = to get last element from a model list
    - earliest = return most eary element by datetime field
    - latest = return most late element by datetime field
    - exists = return if some value exists
    - count = return length of
    - get_previous_by_[datetime field] = return prev object
    - get_next_by_[datetime field] = return next object
