ORM => Object Related Model

we use it to get data from database

exmaple model = Article

!Article.objects.
  - all() = to take all data model
  - order_by('title') = to take data sorted/ordered by title
  - reverse() = to reverse the original data
  - get(pk=1) to take object with has id/pk equal 1

    if we have:
        - primary model: Category
        - secondary model/related model: Article
    we can get all Article models related with Category:
      - category = Category.objects.get(pk=1)
      - category.article_set.all()

      or use it with related_name var which you add to the category = models.ForeignKey()
        - category.[related_name].all()

  with filters:
    to use some filters/lookups you need to write [fieldName]__[filter]
